It's a very simple implement. No framework. Just run 「python main.py」

You can see the support apps in config folder.If u want to check more AppStore APPs, just edit config/app_to_link_mapping_appstore.json file

Key is App name, value is the APP Store Link!

I wrote this project because I always love checking apps for updates.

Only output in terminal.There is a preview.
